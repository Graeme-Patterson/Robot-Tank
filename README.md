Remote Controlled 3D printed Robot Tank

I have an interest in 3D printing and electronics so when I found this 3D prinable tank on Thingiverse, I knew I needed to print one and have some fun with it.
The 3D files are located in the [Proto Tank](/ProtoTank) folder with all credit going to the designer timmiclark and is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.

I have built one and have controlled it using an Arduido UNO with a wired Joystick controller as well as using an ESP8266/Node MCU using Remote XY and used a spare mobile phone as the controller. 
All code is available here:
