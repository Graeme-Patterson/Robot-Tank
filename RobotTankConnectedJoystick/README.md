# What's in the folders

The folders containing Arduino UNO code here are both older versions of a bigger project and don't open correctly.
I had a couple of attempts at getting the logic correct for making the tank move. The New Logic is correct I believe and has been transposed into the code contained in [here](../TankWithWiredJoystick).
