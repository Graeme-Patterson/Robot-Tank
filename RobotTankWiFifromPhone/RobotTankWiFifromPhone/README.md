# The Tank with control from your phone

The remote control functionality here is provided by the RemoteXY app and website found here https://remotexy.com/. The idea is straighforward. You create the interface for the controller using the website. Tell it what device you are using and how yu wish to communicate with it. The code for RemoteXY is generated and you download this to use in your sketch. This is what's in the "RemoteXY Include" commented section in the sketch. The rest of the code uses the input and output controls that the interface provides.

You will need to download the RemoteXY app for your phone and connect to the AP on the tank from within the RemoteXY app to then see the controls on your phone and control the tank.

Here's a quick pic of what this platform currently looks like. I know, I could try harder!
